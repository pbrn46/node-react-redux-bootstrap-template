* Description
My favourite front-end setup: node-react-redux-bootstrap... in a template!

jQuery is included for bootstrap, but generally not needed for use with
node/react projects.

* Usage
The easiest way to use this template is to clone the repository, delete the =.git= folder, and =git init= again.

Remember to run =npm install=


* Packages Included
- react-scripts
- redux
- redux-thunk
- react-redux
- bootstrap
- jquery
- popper.js (for bootstrap)
- tether (for bootstrap)

* Folder structure
** React
React components should reside in =src/components=
** Redux
Reducers, actions, store, and middleware are found in the =src/redux= folder
